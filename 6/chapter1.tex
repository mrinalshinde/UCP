\noindent Image source approach is a systematic way for sound propagation modeling. The primary advantage of image source methods is their robustness. They guarantee that all specular paths up to a given order or reverberation time are found. However, image source methods model only specular reflection, and their expected computational complexity grows exponentially.

\noindent In this assignment we first develop a MATLAB program for determining the pressure distribution. It is then depicted in colour coded two dimensional diagrams. We then discuss the impact of different frequency values on the pressure distribution.
