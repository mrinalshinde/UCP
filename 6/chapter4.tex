\noindent The MATLAB code was written for determining  the signal to noise ratio and carry out calculations for the following parameters. Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) due to wind at various speeds ranging from 5 knots to 25 knots and bottom type of mud, sand and gravel is analysed and observed. The signal to noise ratio is higher at lower winds speeds and on soft surfaces (mud) and thus can be well detected.
