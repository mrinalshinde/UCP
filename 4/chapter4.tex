\noindent Ambient noise due to wind at various speeds ranging from 5 knots to 30 knots is analysed and observed. The effect of wind is dominating at lower frequencies from 100 Hz to 5 kHz. The analysis shows that noise level in dB increases as the wind speed increases. Above 100 kHz, thermal noise contributes to the increase in noise level. 

\noindent We have also observed range of frequencies where different types of noises such as turbulence, traffic, sea state and thermal noises dominate assuming that contribution to noise from rainfall, shrimps and vessel are negligible.
