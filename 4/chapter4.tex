\noindent Using the equations for surface, bottom and volume reverberations, MATLAB programs were written in-order to compute various backscattering coefficients. The surface and bottom backscattering coefficients versus the grazing angle for various sets of (frequency, windspeed) and (frequency, bottom type) respectively was plotted and closely observed. Also the volume reverberation versus frequency graph was obtained and explained for high, moderate and low particle densities.
