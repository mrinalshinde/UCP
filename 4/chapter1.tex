\noindent The ocean ambient noise is the unwanted background noise. They are due to constant sea surface agitation, marine mammals, and man-made sources. Ambient noise is used as an input of sonar equation to predict the performance of underwater acoustical equipment, such as sonar. 

\noindent In this assignment we first develop a MATLAB program for calculating the isotropic ambient noise level. Then we plot the ambient noise level versus frequency for different values of wind speeds. And finally we plot a graph to indicate the frequency domains where either noise level from turbulence, traffic, thermal or sea state dominate.
