\noindent In summary, the radiation pattern is a plot which allows us to visualize where the antenna transmits or receives power. The beam width of a line array is defined as the angular distance between the ?3dB points of lobes. The beam width increases from a minimum at steering angle, $a = 0^{\circ}$ (broadside) to a maximum at $a = 90^{\circ}$ (end fire). To reduce the side lobe level we must weigh the sensor outputs. This procedure of weighing the sensory output is called as Shading. The extra main lobes called the grating lobes are not in the focusing region when the antenna is not steered. But when the antenna is steered, the grating lobes come in to the focusing region which will have a negative influence on the beam pattern of antenna. Sound is slow for propagation in parabolic phase shading. With phase shading the beam is broader for wider transmission from the antenna.
