\noindent By using the formula for velocity of speed in ocean, the graph of velocity of speed in ocean versus depth is plotted for various values of temperature.

\noindent By using the formula for velocity of speed in ocean, the graph of velocity of speed in ocean versus depth for various values of salinity is obtained.

\noindent The dependency of non-linear temperature profile and depth is plotted using an exponential function for temperature. The plot contains of three curves: temperature versus depth, sound velocity (having constant salinity and temperature) versus depth and sound velocity (having expoenential temperature and constant salinity) versus depth.
