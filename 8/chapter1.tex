\noindent SONAR transmitters perform the underwater detection of objects and in most cases, these objects or the SONAR transmitters are in motion. This means that the actual received signal differs from the expected results due to a phenomenon known as Doppler Shift, which is caused by the relative motion of the transmitter and the target. The signal received at the SONAR receivers also changes due to the time delay introduced in the reception of the signals owing to the path travelled by the waves from the transmitter to the target and back to the receiver. These phenomena introduce distortions in the signal received and hence a term called the Ambiguity function is used to study these effects.

\noindent The spectra of Rectangular Pulse, Linear Frequency Modulated Pulse (LFM) with a rectangular envelope and Linear Frequency Modulated Pulse(LFM) with a Gaussian envelope are obtained. The spectra and ambiguity function of all these three functions are plotted and discussed in this assignment
