\noindent It can be concluded that although the ambiguity function gives an idea of the amount of distortion obtained at the matched filter, the above three ambiguity function plots prove that the ambiguity function of any transmitted signal is similar to the signal itself. The figures attain their maximum value at the origin of the plane, and the values of the origin reveal correlations in the signal structure with respect to both time and frequency shifts. And, the ambiguity function has symmetry with respect to the origin.
