\noindent It is proved that while sound moves at a much faster speed in the water than in air, the distance that sound waves travel is primarily dependant upon ocean temperature, salinity and pressure. While pressure continues to increase as ocean depth increases, the temperature of the ocean only decreases up to a certain point, after which it remains relatively stable. These factors have a curious effect on how (and how far) sound waves travel. 

\noindent This assignment consists of three parts: In the first part we develop a MATLAB program for determining the formula for the velocity of sound in ocean.The second part shows the dependence of velocity of sound in ocean on temperature, salinity and depth. Finally the dependency of the nonlinear temperature profile and the depth of the ocean is plotted.
